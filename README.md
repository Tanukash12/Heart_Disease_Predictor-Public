# Heart_Disease_Predictor
A machine learning project that predicts the likelihood of heart disease using patient health data and logistic regression. Includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualizations.
This project applies machine learning techniques to predict the presence of heart disease in patients using clinical parameters such as age, gender, cholesterol levels, resting blood pressure, fasting blood sugar, maximum heart rate, and exercise-induced angina.

The workflow includes:

1. Data Preprocessing: Cleaning, handling missing values, and preparing the dataset for training.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing key health indicators and their correlation with heart disease.

3. Feature Selection: Identifying the most significant risk factors.

4. Model Training: Implementing Logistic Regression (with scikit-learn) to classify patients as “likely to have heart disease” or “not likely”.

5. Evaluation: Assessing the model using accuracy metrics.

Result: The trained model achieves strong performance and provides a foundation for developing decision-support systems in healthcare.
Achieved ~84% accuracy on the test dataset.

This project highlights how machine learning can assist in early disease detection, offering valuable insights for doctors and patients while showcasing data science skills in preprocessing, visualization, and model building.
